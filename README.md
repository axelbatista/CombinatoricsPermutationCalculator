Uses the powerset program and the permutation program I made in tandem with each other (which requires some slight modifications)
in order to produce this program, which gives you all the permutations of 1 to N objects of a given sized m set. So let's you say have items from 1 to 8,
you can get all the permutations of those eight items with only taking 6 items at a time, for example. Can just modify it to your liking. The up to what value for changing the amount of
items like the powerset program is towards the bottom right on top of the power set program, but besides that it works like how you'd expect the combination of the permutation
and power set program to work.
